webpack transpiles Typescript to javascript so that it can be understood 
by browsers 

when we create a new component, it automatically added in app.module.ts 
in @NgModule({ declarations: -->...,}), and also above after import


to use http request to communicate with api we import "httpclientmodule" from angular/common
and we add the import in inports


we install bootstrap and fontawesome and refer them in styles.css
