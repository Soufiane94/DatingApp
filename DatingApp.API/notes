 configuration on startup.cs
 //for each model we created, we put  in DataContext.cs --> Db<Model> Model(s) 
// we then use the commmand "dotnet ef migrations add MigrationClassName" in terminal 
// and then, to create db we use the cmd "dotnet ef database update"

//we create a constructor in our main controller (ValuesController) and we pass as paremeter
a DataContext parameter that will be stored in a private readonly DataContext property
...
{
this.context = context
}
...

_context = context

//we turn the Actionresult into asynchronous code, using the async Task<> return type and await and listasync
